## Project Requiremennts
|Sections|Description|What I did|
|--------|-----------|----------|
|Header|Name, site title, and a simple navigation menu (links can be placeholders)|✅ I put a simple logo I created on my own at the top of the image with my digital space username. I also made a simple navigation menu that is linked to the sections of my website.|
|About Me| A short paragraph introducing the student with an image.|✅ I put in my 2x2 ID + a short description of what I contribute to the professional space. I implemented a simple flex wrap here so I can put my image and the paragraph side by side. I am forever thankful of StacksOverflow!|
|Hobbies & Interests|A list of at least three hobbies with brief descriptions.|✅ I put in five because I am extra :D I took advantage of the pointer hover for the interactivity in this part.|
|Contact Info| A section displaying an email address and social media links (placeholders)|✅ Ths one is simple but it took me a long time because I was trying to insert font-awesome icon to achieve that minimalistic look. However, I am running out of time and there's nothing wrong with a little color anyway. I selected the circular version of the logos so they look cuter.|

|Navigation Menu|A simple top menu with working anchor links|📍 As stated previously, I linked the navigation menu to certain sections of the page|
|Hover Effects|CSS styling changes when hovering over buttons or images.| 💗 This is what I did on "My hobbies" section
|JavaScript Interaction|A button that displays a fun fact about the student when clicked| ❗Almost forgot this. But I managed to put a simple button for the fun fact :) |
|Mobile-Friendly Layout|Use CSS media queries to ensure the site looks good on different screen sizes.|✨ There's an element in the <head> section that allowed this. I tested the website on my phone and the website was wrapped automatically.|
